                This app is currently in its beta testing phase. Being in beta means that you get a firsthand experience of our features 
            before they're rolled out to the broader public. However, it also means that you might encounter unexpected bugs or issues 
            along the way. We’re constantly working behind the scenes to refine and improve, but we appreciate your patience and 
            understanding if things don’t always work seamlessly.

                The lifespan and future trajectory of this app remain uncertain. Based on feedback, testing results, and various other factors, 
            we might make significant changes, or the app might even be removed from availability without prior notice. There's also the 
            possibility that the app could experience interruptions or stop working due to unforeseen circumstances.
